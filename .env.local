# 2. After setting or changing this key, you MUST restart your development server
#    for the changes to take effect (e.g., stop `npm run dev` and run it again).
#
# DO NOT commit this file to version control if it contains your actual API key.
# If you are using a .env file (without .local), make sure it's in your .gitignore.
